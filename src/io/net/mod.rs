//! The io/net module provides a comprehensive set of asynchronous traits and utilities for working
//! with network sockets.
//!
//! These abstractions facilitate the creation and management
//! of TCP and UDP connections, along with supporting operations like connecting, accepting,
//! sending, receiving, binding, and shutting down sockets.
